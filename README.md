# Simple Graph Plotter

## About

**What?**

This application is a simple polynomial graph plotter. It allows the user to input a simple equation like
*y=2x^2 + 2* and then display a graph corresponding to the equation.

**Who?**

People who study anything related to math can find this tool useful. Graphing an equation can quickly show many 
useful properties like:
- domain and range
- intercepts
- shape
- behaviour at large values of x,y, etc.
- and many more...

**Why?**

I am interested in making this project because I like studying math and want to make something related to such interest.
This is also a good way to test and expand my programming knowledge.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to see a graph of a polynomial equation
- As a user, I want to be able to add an equation to a list of equations to graph
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of the equations of the graphs
- As a user, I want to be able to select an existing graph and change its equation
- As a user, I want to be able to delete an existing graph
